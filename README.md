### Why Ethereum?
We are strong believers in Ethereum, a public blockchain that allows anyone to build unstoppable, censorship-resistant applications. On Ethereum, anyone can deploy software that controls digital value and is accessible around the world. Born in 2014, the Ethereum network houses over $60 billion worth of value today, hosting projects such as:
— Global, decentralized organizations
— Non-reserve-backed, stable-value currencies
— Fully-open, permissionless, financial applications
We believe Ethereum represents a fundamental shift in how financial systems operate and are dedicated to its mission.




### Building blocks for a
decentralized infrastructure
Our work touches every part of the Ethereum and Starknet ecosystem, from our full nodes to cryptography research and application-layer protocol development.

A full-featured client for the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake protocol, written in Go
The Prysm project is a Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol as detailed by its official specification. It contains a full beacon node implementation as well as a validator client for participating in blockchain consensus. Prysm utilizes top tools for production servers and interprocess communication, using Google's gRPC library, BoltDB as an optimized, persistent, key-value store, and libp2p by Protocol Labs for all peer-to-peer networking.
